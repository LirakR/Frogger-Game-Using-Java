# Frogger-Game-Using-Java
This is a recreation of the classic Frogger game from 1981. In this game u play as a frog who wants to go to the leaves on top of the screen. The interesting thing about this project is the usage of gifs for the jumping animation which is not something that I've seen before. Enjoy :)

If u want to run the game just run Main.java
